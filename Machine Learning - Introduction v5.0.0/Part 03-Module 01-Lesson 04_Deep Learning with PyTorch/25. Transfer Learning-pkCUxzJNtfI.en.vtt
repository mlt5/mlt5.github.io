00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
When you're tackling a new problem with a neural network,

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:06.419
it might help to start with an existing network that was built for

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.035
a similar task and then try to fine-tune it for your own problem.

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.695
There are a couple of good reasons to do this.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.219
First, existing neural networks can be really useful.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.954
If somebody has taken days or weeks to train a network already,

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.104
then a lot of intelligence is stored in that network.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:28.140
Taking advantage of that work can accelerate your own progress.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.015
Second, sometimes the data set for the problem you'll work on might be small.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.039
In those cases, look for

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.155
an existing network that's designed for a problem similar to your own.

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.450
If that network has already been trained on a larger data set,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.785
then you can use it as a starting point to help your own network generalize better.

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:48.409
In order to do this,

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.339
it makes sense to learn a little bit about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.340
the most prominent pre-trained networks that already exist.
