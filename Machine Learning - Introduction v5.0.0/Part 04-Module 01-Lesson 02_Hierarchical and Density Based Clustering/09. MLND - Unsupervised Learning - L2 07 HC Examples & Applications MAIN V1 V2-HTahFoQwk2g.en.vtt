00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's look at a few examples of hierarchical clustering.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.634
But before that, we can discuss advantages and disadvantages.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.160
The main advantage that we get from hierarchical clustering is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.519
that the resulting hierarchical representations are

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.039
very informative and they provide us with

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.035
an additional ability to visualize the clustering structure of the datasets.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:25.320
Hierarchical clustering is especially potent when the data

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
contains real hierarchical relationships inside of it,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.045
kind of like evolutionary biology.

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:34.850
The disadvantages of hierarchical clustering is that, one,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.240
it's sensitive to noise and outliers so you're going to have to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.500
clean up the data set from any noise and outliers beforehand,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.570
and that it's computationally intensive.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.200
So if you have a large data set with a lot of dimensions,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.925
it can be a little bit slow running at big O of N squared.

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:56.689
One example of an application of hierarchical clustering

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.799
is this paper that uses average linkage, actually,

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:09.079
to cluster secreted proteins and uses that to create clusters different types of fungus.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:18.469
Another example uses complete linkage to draw this diagram of the human microbiome.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.629
And you'll find links to these and other applications in the text below the video.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:25.399
And with this, now,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.930
we are ready to look at density-based clustering with DBSCAN in the next video.
