00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
Let's say that our local repository has these branches in it.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.844
Master, footer fix, and bugfix-login-form.

00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:10.075
These branches are local,

00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:12.509
meaning they exist only on our machine and are

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.000
not shared with other developers using the repository.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.410
When we create a remote repository,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.390
it starts out empty, typically.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.975
To get the commits that are on these branches over to the remote repository,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.760
we need to send them over.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.370
We can do this in two ways,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.179
we can merge footer fix and bugfix-login-form into

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.000
master and just send master to the remote repository,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
or we can send all three branches to the remote repository.
