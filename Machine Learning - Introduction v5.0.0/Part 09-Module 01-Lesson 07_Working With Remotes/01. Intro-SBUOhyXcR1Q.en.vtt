00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello and welcome to this course on GitHub

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.870
and how to collaborate on a version control project.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.179
Let's chat briefly about collaboration and why it's so important.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.685
I mean, it's got to be important if we're creating an entire course on it.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.990
Well, collaboration is incredibly beneficial because most of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.254
the time you won't be working by yourself as a lone developer on a project.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.765
You'll be working with a team,

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.594
maybe with people you don't even know,

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.554
or maybe you're contributing to an open-source project.

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:30.119
So being able to work collaboratively is a vital skill to have,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.810
but it's especially important when you're working on a coding project.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.990
One of the key aspects of collaboration is being able to communicate

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.277
clearly what you're doing and being able to work with others,

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:41.774
like the project's maintainers,

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:43.969
to see how you can contribute.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.844
This communication can be kind of tricky when working remotely and asynchronously.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:49.993
After going through this course,

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:53.144
you'll be able to work with others on a version control project,

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:58.289
use GitHub and its features to plan changes and implement those changes,

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.719
contribute to an existing repository,

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.867
and then how to add features to a project while it's in active development.

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.030
And if you're taking this course,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.709
then I'm expecting you to already have

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:12.025
a pretty solid experience with version control and specifically with Git.

00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:16.140
I've got a list of skills that I expect you to be comfortable with below this video.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
Now if you're new to Git and version control in general, don't worry.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.750
I've created a course called "Version Control with

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.435
Git" that will bring you up to speed on everything you need to know.

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.144
A link to that course is below.

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:31.530
So, the first thing we need to look at before we get into GitHub, collaboration,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.680
or anything else is understanding what a remote repository is and how to work with one.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.280
So, let's check that out now.
