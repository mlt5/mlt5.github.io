00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.220
OK so regardless of
what system you're on,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.030
you're going to want to open
up a terminal window now.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.660
On Windows, that's the Git
Bash you've been working with.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.560
On the Mac, you'll find
the terminal program

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.140
in the Utilities folder.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.850
On a Linux system,
the terminal program

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
is usually pretty easy to find,
but can be in different places.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.720
It doesn't matter which terminal
program you end up using,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:26.820
the terminal is just an
interface to the Shell

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.445
and to other command
line programs that

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.760
will be running inside it.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.920
Kind of like how your web
browser is an interface

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.960
to websites and services.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.299
Now, pretty much
every terminal program

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.459
has a bunch of settings
that you can mess around

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.277
with to change the fonts,
and colors, and so on.

00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:44.609
Now, we're not going to do a
lot of that in this course.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.424
But do feel free to
adjust them to whatever

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:48.719
is comfortable for you.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.149
Now something to
keep in mind, you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.859
can have multiple
terminals open at once.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.329
In fact, you can have any number
of terminals open at once.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.879
Each one of them has its
own instance of the Shell--

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.830
a separate process
on your computer.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.039
So if you happen to do
something in one terminal that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.920
freezes or breaks it,
well, you can always

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.829
just use another one.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.049
As you go through this
course, another thing

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.819
that will help you is to
look things up online.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.849
There is a wealth of
information about the Unix

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.140
shell on the web.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.359
If you're wondering
how to do something

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.310
or looking for a command that
you've never seen before,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.600
use your favorite search engine.
