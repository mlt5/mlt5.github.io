00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.419
So with all
of this CDing around,

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.118
it's possible to
get kind of lost.

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:10.279
Depending on your
system, the shell prompt

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.589
might or might not tell you
what directory you're in,

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.289
but there is a command
that will always tell you,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.629
the pwd command.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.989
That stands for Print
Working Directory.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.049
The working directory is another
word for whatever directory

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.179
the shell is
currently looking at.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.269
It's the default directory
for commands like ls.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.219
And it's the default
place that shell commands

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.109
will look for data files.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.909
You'll notice that the
names of directories

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.309
are separated by slashes.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.640
The Unix system uses the forward
slash, not the backslash,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.770
to separate the
names of directories.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.280
Forward slash is the same one
you've seen in URLs on the web.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.550
This whole string, composed
of several directory

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.939
names separated by
slashes, is called a path.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.619
There are a few special
directory names.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.349
You've seen dot,
dot before, it means

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.000
the parent directory,
the directory

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.189
that this directory is inside.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.569
There's also dot, just
means the current directory.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.049
ls dot is just the same as ls.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.230
And the shell also has a
shortcut, the tilde, which

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.900
stands for my home directory.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.140
Like regardless of what
directory your CD'd into,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.849
ls tilde will list
your home directory.
