00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.189
The shell is actually a little programming language.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.570
Just like JavaScript or Python, it has variables.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.440
They look a little different though.

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.219
In the shell, whenever you create or modify a variable,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.214
you just give it a name and an equal sign,

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.300
followed by the value that you want it to have.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.070
Note that you can't put any spaces around the equal sign.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.320
Then when you want to refer to the variable,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.475
you put a dollar sign in front of its name.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.660
But they're actually two different kinds of variables in the shell.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.259
One of them is called a shell variable.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:37.619
The lines and columns variables that you saw earlier are these kind.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.969
These are just internal to the shell program itself.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.274
The other kind is called an environment variable.

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:48.859
Environment variables are shared with programs that you run from within the shell.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.590
One environment variable that's really important is the path variable.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.570
That tells your system where your program files are.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.910
So when you type a command,

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.289
such as LS, it can find the program to run it.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.495
For instance, on my system the LS program is in slash bin slash LS.

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:08.594
So it's in the slash bin directory,

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:12.120
and the slash bin directory is here in my path variable.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.260
The directories in the path variable are separated by

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.490
colons and the shell searches them starting with the first one,

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.534
and then proceeding to the right until it finds the command that you entered.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:27.439
That's how the shell is able to find the LS command when I want to run.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.409
You'll sometimes see instructions telling you to add a directory to your path,

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.539
so that programs in it can be found.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.880
To add the new directory to the end of your path,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:40.185
you do it like this: path equals dollar sign path colon,

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.299
and then the new directory.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.840
But if you do it like this right at the shell prompt,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.025
that change will only last until you close the shell.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.745
We'll take a look at where you do it if you want to keep that changed next.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.329
But first a couple of quizzes.
