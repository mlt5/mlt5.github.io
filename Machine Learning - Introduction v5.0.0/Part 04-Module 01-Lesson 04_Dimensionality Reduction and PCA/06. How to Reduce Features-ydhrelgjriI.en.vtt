00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.919
You now have an idea

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.129
of how the many features of a survey or home,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.480
can actually fall into just a few main buckets.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.359
Because these buckets are explicitly in the data,

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.698
we call them latent features.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.260
So the question is,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.179
how do we actually take all of the data we have from all of these features and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.644
condense it to only a few number of features that hold the most amount of information?

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:38.859
One option, is that we could just choose a subset of the features for each

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.134
latent variable that best captures the essence of that latent variable.

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:46.394
Maybe the square footage of the home.

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:49.200
Best captures the latent variable related to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.975
home size and we could drop these other features related to the number of bedrooms,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.635
the number of bathrooms, garages, etc.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:01.384
We could perhaps do this with the other latent features as well,

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.579
but it seems like we're losing a lot of

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.084
potentially helpful information by simply dropping all of these features.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.140
There has to be a better way we can reduce the number of

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.189
features in our dataset without simply dropping all of them.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.694
Well, in fact there is a way we can preserve

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:22.284
more of the information and one of the main methods for doing this, is PCA.

00:01:22.284 --> 00:01:25.479
The very topic of this lesson.
