00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.750
Consider this dataset.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.970
On the x-axis is the amount of time in minutes it

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.750
takes to run five kilometers for 100 individuals.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.320
On the y-axis is each individual score on a standardized test on a scale from 200 to 800.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.079
Notice that this provides two clusters,

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.375
one exists up here at the top for those with higher test scores,

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:31.925
and another exists here for those with lower test scores.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:37.219
However, let's say we change the x-axis to represent seconds instead,

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.524
and the y-axis to represent test scores.

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:42.810
Then we have two different clusters,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.210
one for those with faster running times,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.155
and another set for those with slower running times.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.450
When using minutes, the computed distance between

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.840
individuals is smaller than when using seconds.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.859
Similarly, we have larger distances between individuals when

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.090
using lower test scores rather than standardized test scores.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.340
This is just one example of how

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.320
feature scaling might change the final clusters determined by a model.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.639
For this reason, it's important to standardize your data before clustering.
