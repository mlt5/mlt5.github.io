00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.655
You now have seen in the main ideas associated and working with k-means.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.389
From understanding clustering as an unsupervised approach,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.690
to choosing the appropriate number of clusters.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.640
But how do we actually build an algorithm that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.425
figures out where the cluster centers are for these clusters?

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:24.275
Let's take a closer look at how this works.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.570
Let's use this plot as an example,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.304
and go step-by-step through how the k-means algorithm works.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:31.739
When we start out,

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.234
we just have clusters of points with no groupings.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:39.629
We start k-means by randomly placing k points onto our plot,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.020
where k is the number of clusters you want to end up with.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.210
We call each of these k points a centroid.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.049
They're just randomly placed amongst the data,

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.644
so we need to move them.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:55.835
The way we do this is to assign each point in our dataset to the closest centroid.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:59.299
Now that we know which points belong in each group,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.924
we move the centroid to the center of these points.

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:04.189
Once the centroid has moved,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.609
points may be closer to the centroid of a different group.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.500
Now, we will calculate the distance from each point to each centroid,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.819
and again assign each point to the closest centroid.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.125
With this new assignment of points,

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.379
we will again want to move the centroids to

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.984
the middle of the group of the points assigned to it.

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:27.379
This process will continue until the centroids no longer move.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.039
This ends our search.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.840
Here we have these k groups of clusters as our final results.
