00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.214
You've now had some practice

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.300
with identifying the number of clusters in the data

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.530
set when you can clearly see clusterings of point,

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.884
as well as when there are some preconceived ideas about how many clusters might exist.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:22.365
But what about when you have no idea how many clusters might be in the data?

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:26.509
How might we determine the k in k-means for these cases?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.100
For this I would like to introduce a method known as the Elbow Method.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.679
The way this works is that for any set of data,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.189
we could try fitting k-means with differing numbers of k,

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:41.250
then for each value of k we can measure

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.210
the the average distance of each point from the center point of the cluster.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.490
If we kept track of the average distance for each value of k,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.825
we could create a plot that looks like this.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:58.315
On the x-axis, you can see that we have the number of clusters or k. On

00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:01.375
the y-axis we have the average distance of

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:05.640
each point from the center of the cluster across all of the clusters.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.510
You can see here as the number of clusters increases,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.859
the average distance from each point to the center decreases.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.804
However, with each additional center,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.945
the impact on the average distance is not the same.

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:21.769
With small values of k,

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:25.875
each additional center greatly decreases the average distance.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:30.064
With larger values of k this makes less and less of an impact.

00:01:30.064 --> 00:01:34.579
The main point of interest in this plot is what is known as the Elbow.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.039
At this point, we have found a number of clusters that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.695
significantly reduces the distance from each point to the center of the cluster.

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:47.879
At the same time increasing k does not appear to have a substantial impact.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:51.449
Finding the Elbow can be a bit of a judgement call.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.920
You're looking for the point when increasing k no

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.335
longer leads to a large decrease in the distance from the centers.

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:00.799
Let's get some practice with this.
