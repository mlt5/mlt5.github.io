00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.060
The K in K-means relates to how many clusters you want to split your data into.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.985
So in a case like this,

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:14.074
three clusters looks like it probably works best.

00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:17.434
Alternatively, if we had this set of points,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.579
three clusters doesn't seem right.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.474
In this case, two clusters looks like it makes more sense.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:27.350
When we have lots of data in a large number of dimensions,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.195
how do we decide how many centers to choose?

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:35.484
Choosing K in practice is often a mix of art and science.

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:38.600
Sometimes, researchers are interested in choosing

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.030
a specific K value based on preconceived ideas about a topic.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.355
One example of this happens right here at Eudacity,

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:50.084
we believe that students generally fall into one of three categories;

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:51.980
students who are new to a field,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.669
students who are interested in scaling up their careers,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.960
or students who are changing careers.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.640
So, it makes sense to use K-means with K equal to three to see if our data

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.254
supports this idea of three types of students or three clusters of students.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.949
Sometimes, we don't have an idea of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.210
how many clusters there should be before we collect data.

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.094
For these cases, we'll look at another method

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:19.640
that can be used to find the number of clusters in a dataset
