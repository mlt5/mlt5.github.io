00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
I'm on my course-collaboration-travel-plans,

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.448
a project that I forked from Lahm's here.

00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:09.780
And so, I want my changes to be in this project- in her project.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.204
So I need to send a pull request.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:15.474
Good thing there's a new pull request button right here.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:19.425
This is the page where we were able to start a new pull request.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.439
So this is showing us my master branch,

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.554
on my repository, compared to the master branch on Lahm's project.

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:30.210
Right now there isn't anything to compare because both of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.325
these branches are pointing to the exact same commits.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:37.609
So let's switch my branch to the new branch that I just pushed.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.240
So let's go over this one more time,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.115
because this area right here can be a little bit tricky.

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:44.545
This is my project and my branch,

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:50.020
and I'm comparing this change with Lahm's project and her master branch.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.410
And the changes between her master branch and my branch right here are listed down below.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.919
There are three commits on my branch that aren't in her master branch,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.179
and two files have changed.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.129
These are the commits and down here are the files that have changed.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.394
So in this css file these lines were added,

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:10.719
and in the index file these lines were added.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.599
Let's scroll back up here,

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:16.119
and now we can just click on this create pull request button.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.935
So the view has changed a little bit.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.510
Now, we're presented with this form here,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.120
where we can actually send the pull request.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.859
We have the pull request title right here,

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.010
which you can see is populated from the same name as the branch name.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.265
So this is another reason why you'd want to name your branches with descriptive names.

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:38.010
I think this is a good pull request title so I'll leave that as is,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.590
and I'm going to write a little message.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.859
Now, this area down here supports markdown.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.894
This looks good to me,

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:48.329
so let's scroll down here and click on the create pull request button.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.679
Notice though, we have now switched away from my project and my page,

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.850
I am now on the udacity account,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.280
but looking at Lahm's project.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.530
And instead of being on the code tab,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.915
this has switched to the pull request tab,

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:06.195
and it is showing us the conversation here.

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:08.658
Now the conversation includes a little bit of information:

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:11.729
The message I've provided and the commits that I pushed.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.539
And we can see those commits in more detail here.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.199
And then if we want to look at the actual files

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.524
that have changed- we can see that on this tab.

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:21.330
Let's switch back to the conversations tab.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.590
Scrolling down, we can see that this branch has no conflicts

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.724
with Lahm's base branch or Lahm's master branch,

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:29.294
but we can't do anything with this,

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.849
we need Lahm to be able to include

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.775
these changes- to include this pull request in her master branch,

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:39.000
because she owns this repository.
