              "text": "In this lesson, you will be extending your knowledge of simple linear regression, where you were predicting a quantitative response variable using a quantitative explanatory variable.  That is, you were using an equation that looked like this:\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1</span>\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about multiple linear regression.  In these cases, you will be using both quantitative and categorical x-variables to predict a quantitative response.  That is, you will be creating equations that like this to predict your response:\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + b_4x_4</span>\n\nFurthermore, you will learn about how to assess problems that can happen in multiple linear regression, how to address these problems, and how to assess how well your model is performing.  It turns out **Rsquared** can be used, but might be misleading.  And, unfortunately, the correlation coefficient is only a measure of the linear relationship between **two quantitative** variables, so it will not be very useful in the multiple linear regression case.  \n\nHere is a wonderful free supplementary book: [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf). This is an absolutely spectacular book for getting started with machine learning, and Chapter 3 discusses many of the ideas in this lesson. The programming performed in the text is in R, but here is an additional resource, not created by the book's authors, that provides Jupyter Notebooks in Python with notes and answers to nearly all the questions from the book: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/6rkh3u/introduction_to_statistical_learning_with_python/",

That is, all of the columns of <span class=\"mathquill\">X</span> must be linearly independent.\n\nIf you do not drop one of the columns (from the model, not from the dataframe) when creating the dummy variables, your solution is unstable and results from Python are unreliable.  You will see an example of what happens if you do not drop one of the dummy columns in the next concept.\n\nThe takeaway is ... **when you create dummy variables using 0, 1 encodings, you always need to drop one of the columns from the model to make sure your matrices are full rank (and that your solutions are reliable from Python).** \n\nThe reason for this is linear algebra.  Specifically, in order to invert matrices, a matrix must be full rank (that is, all the columns need to be linearly independent).  Therefore, you need to drop one of the dummy columns, to create linearly independent columns (and a full rank matrix).",

              "text": "### Model Assumptions And How To Address Each\n\nHere are the five potential problems related to Multiple Linear Regression that we mentioned in the previous video, that are addressed in [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf):\n\n1. Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships\n2. Correlation of error terms\n3. Non-constant Variance and Normally Distributed Errors\n4. Outliers/ High leverage points\n5. Multicollinearity\n\nThis text is a summary of how to identify whether these problems exist, as well as how to address them. \n This is a common interview question asked by statisticians, but its practical importance is hit or miss depending on the purpose of your model.  In the upcoming concepts, we will look more closely at specific points that I believe deserve more attention, but below you will see a more exhaustive introduction to each topic.  Let's take a closer look at each of these items.  \n\n#### Linearity\n\nThe assumption of linearity is that a linear model is the relationship that truly exists between your response and predictor variables.  If this isn't true, then your predictions will not be very accurate.  Additionally, the linear relationships associated with your coefficients really aren't useful either.\n\nIn order to assess if a linear relationship is reasonable, a plot of the residuals <span class=\"mathquill\">(y - \\hat{y})</span> by the predicted values <span class=\"mathquill\">(\\hat{y})</span> is often  useful.  If there are curvature patterns in this plot, it suggests that a linear model might not actually fit the data, and some other relationship exists between the predictor variables and response.  There are many ways to create non-linear models (even using the linear model form), and you will be introduced to a few of these later in this lesson.\n\nIn the image at the bottom of this page, these are considered the **biased** models.  Ideally, we want to see a random scatter of points like the top left residual plot in the image.\n",

              "text": "\n#### Correlated Errors\n\nCorrelated errors frequently occur when our data are collected over time (like in forecasting stock prices or interest rates in the future) or data are spatially related (like predicting flood or drought regions).  We can often improve our predictions by using information from the past data points (for time) or the points nearby (for space).  \n\nThe main problem with not accounting for correlated errors is that you can often use this correlation to your advantage to better predict future events or events spatially close to one another. \n\nOne of the most common ways to identify if you have correlated errors is based on the domain from which the data were collected.  If you are unsure, there is a test known as a [Durbin-Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic) test that is commonly used to assess whether correlation of the errors is an issue.  Then [ARIMA or ARMA](http://www.statsref.com/HTML/index.html?arima.html) models are commonly implemented to use this correlation to make better predictions.\n\n#### Non-constant Variance and Normally Distributed Errors\n\nNon-constant variance is when the spread of your predicted values differs depending on which value you are trying to predict.  This isn't a huge problem in terms of predicting well.  However, it does lead to confidence intervals and p-values that are inaccurate.  Confidence intervals for the coefficients will be too wide for areas where the actual values are closer to the predicted values, but too narrow for areas where the actual values are more spread out from the predicted values.\n\nCommonly, a log (or some other transformation of the response variable is done) in order to \"get rid\" of the non-constant variance.  In order to choose the transformation, a [Box-Cox](http://www.statisticshowto.com/box-cox-transformation/) is commonly used.\n\nNon-constant variance can be assessed again using a plot of the residuals by the predicted values.  In the image at the bottom of the page, non-constant variance is labeled as **heteroscedastic**.  Ideally, we want an unbiased model with homoscedastic residuals (consistent across the range of values).  \n\nThough the text does not discuss normality of the residuals, this is an important assumption of regression if you are interested in creating reliable confidence intervals.  More on this topic is provided [here](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/section2/pri24.htm).\n\n#### Outliers/Leverage Points\n\nOutliers and leverage points are points that lie far away from the regular trends of your data.  These points can have a large influence on your solution.  In practice, these points might even be typos.  If you are aggregating data from multiple sources, it is possible that some of the data values were carried over incorrectly or aggregated incorrectly.  \n\nOther times outliers are accurate and true data points, not necessarily measurement or data entry errors.  In these cases, 'fixing' is more subjective. Often the strategy for working with these points is dependent on the goal of your analysis.  Linear models using ordinary least squares, in particular, are not very robust.  That is, large outliers may greatly change our results.  There are techniques to combat this - largely known as **regularization** techniques.  These are beyond the scope of this class, but they are quickly discussed in the [free course on machine learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120).\n\n#### Multi-collinearity\n\nMulticollinearity is when we have predictor variables that are correlated with one another.  One of the main concerns of multicollinearity is that it can lead to coefficients being flipped from the direction we expect from simple linear regression.\n\nOne of the most common ways to identify multicollinearity is with bivariate plots or with **variance inflation factors (or VIFs)**.  This is a topic we will dive into in the next concept, so we won't spend as much time on it here.",

              "text": "**We would like x-variables to be related to the response, but not to be related to one another.**  When our x-variables are correlated with one another, this is known as **multicollinearity**.  Multicollinearity has two potential negative impacts.  As you saw in the previous example, \n\n1. The expected relationships between your x-variables and the response may not hold when multicollinearity is present.  That is, you may expect a positive relationship between the explanatory variables and the response (based on the bivariate relationships), but in the multiple linear regression case, it turns out the relationship is negative.<br><br>\n2. Our hypothesis testing results may not be reliable.  It turns out that having correlated explanatory variables means that our coefficient estimates are less stable.  That is, standard deviations (often called standard errors) associated with your regression coefficients are quite large.  Therefore, a particular variable might be useful for predicting the response, but because of the relationship it has with other x-variables, you will no longer see this association.\n\nWe have also looked at two different ways of identifying multicollinearity:\n\n1. Looking at the correlation of each explanatory variable with each other explanatory variable (with a plot or the correlation coefficient).<br>\n2. Looking at VIFs for each variable.\n\nWhen VIFs are greater than 10, this suggests that multicollinearity is certainly a problem in your model.  Some experts even suggest that VIFs of greater than 5 can be problematic. In most cases, not just one VIF is high, but rather many VIFs are high, as these are measures of how related variables are with one another.  \n\nThe most common way of working with correlated explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression model is simply to remove one of the variables that is most related to the other variables.  Choosing an explanatory variable that you aren't interested in, or isn't as important to you, is a common choice.  ",

You might be wondering: \"How do I identify if I need one of these higher order terms?\"\n\nWhen creating models with **quadratic**, **cubic**, or even higher orders of a variable, we are essentially looking at how many curves there are in the relationship between the explanatory and response variables.  \n\nIf there is one curve, like in the plot below, then you will want to add a quadratic.

You learned how to build a multiple linear regression model in Python, which was actually very similar to what you did in the last lesson on simple linear regression.<br><br>\n\n2. You learned how to encode dummy variables, and interpret the coefficients attached to each.<br><br>\n\n3. You learned about higher order terms, and how this impacts your ability to interpret coefficients.<br><br>\n\n4. You learned how to identify what it would mean for an interaction to be needed in a multiple linear regression model, as well as how to identify other higher order terms.  But again, these do make interpreting coefficients directly less of a priority, and move your model towards one that, rather, aims to predict better at the expense of interpretation.<br><br>\n\n5. You learned about the model assumptions, and we took a closer look at multicollinearity.  You learned about variance inflation factors, and how multicollinearity impacts the model coefficients and standard errors.",
