00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940
If you've been following

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.630
the headlines related to artificial intelligence and machine learning,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.260
you probably have heard of deep learning.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.070
Deep learning has beaten

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.524
essentially all other machine-learning algorithms in its ability to predict,

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.534
and it can actually be used for supervised,

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:25.734
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.673
From a historical perspective,

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:30.579
the growth of this technique makes a lot of sense.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.349
Over time, we've cared less and less about how we make predictions,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.620
and now we care more about the accuracy of our predictions.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:42.979
This connects well to the advancement of deep learning where we rarely

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.254
understand all of how or why our model make certain predictions.

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:53.145
Unfortunately, deep learning is not the solution to every problem.

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:56.225
It has three major barriers to entry.

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.480
First, you must have enough data.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.774
Deep learning requires a lot of data.

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:06.019
Second, you must have the computing power.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:10.459
In order to reach superhuman performance in the game of Go,

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:18.514
Google's DeepMind AlphaGo required 1,202 CPUs and 176 GPUs.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:24.265
Third, you probably won't understand why certain decisions were being made,

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:27.939
given the complexity and flexibility of these algorithms.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.299
For these reasons, not every

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.869
application of machine learning is one that requires deep learning.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.655
You'll be getting some practice using deep learning in this program.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:42.599
However, we have an entire deep learning nanodegree program available on the subject.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.489
So, it's not the primary focus of this program.
