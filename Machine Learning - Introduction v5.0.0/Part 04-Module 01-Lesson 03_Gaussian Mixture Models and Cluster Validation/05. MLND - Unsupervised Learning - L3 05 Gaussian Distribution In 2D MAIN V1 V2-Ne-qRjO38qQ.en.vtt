00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
Let's say, we're looking at two test scores for each student that we have.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:06.990
Let's say we have 99 students.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.804
We have, for each one,

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:12.074
the chemistry score, and the geology test score.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:17.009
And each of these columns has its own mean and standard deviation.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.080
If we plot these in two dimensions where chemistry score is the X axis,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.014
and geology score is the Y axis,

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.664
we have a shape like this.

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:29.070
We can plot histograms like this for each axis,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.929
each test score, and we can see the bell curves re-emerging here.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.560
And since this dataset has more than one variable,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.195
and each of the two variables is a Gaussian distribution,

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:46.335
this dataset is called a Multivariate Gaussian distribution.

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:49.185
So, it's a Gaussian distribution in more than one variable.

00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:51.390
And one visual way to look at

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.310
a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution is through these concentric circles.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.600
And so, the center here is the mean of the two axis,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.954
and this first ellipse is the mean plus or minus the standard deviation along each axis.

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:12.929
And so, this circle would contain 68 percent of the data points,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.450
the second circle would contain 95,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.835
and then this will contain 99 percent.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:21.164
And so, each concentric ellipse shows us

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:27.070
where one or two or three standard deviations lie in that dataset.
