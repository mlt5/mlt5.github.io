00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.845
Let's recap Gaussian distributions in one dimension.

00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:07.214
Say, we have test scores as an example.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:12.934
Assume that this is a dataset of how a class of students did on a certain exam.

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:16.035
Test scores tend to have this general distribution.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.405
Since there's a bit of overlap in the middle here,

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:22.280
and it's hard to see how densely packed this region is,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.570
we will plot a histogram.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.519
The height of the histogram is basically how many points are in this band.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.125
So, we can see that this is the highest bar,

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:35.234
so this indicates that this band here,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.920
this contains the highest number of points from

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.350
all of the bands that are in the same size.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.814
This histogram shows us

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:49.920
the familiar bell curve that defines a Gaussian distribution, or normal distribution.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
This is how a Gaussian distribution looks in one dimension.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.795
The numbers that describe a Gaussian distribution are,

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:00.585
one, is the mean or average,

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:05.549
here it's 66, we give it the name Î¼ here,

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.284
and the standard deviation.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.834
And so, the standard deviation in this case is 15,

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:13.375
that's easy to calculate.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.045
And so, this region here,

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:19.064
which is the mean plus one standard deviation,

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:22.745
and the mean minus one standard deviation,

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:28.310
this point here contains 68 percent of the points in the dataset.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.344
This is a property of a Gaussian distribution.

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:32.730
In this area here,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.750
which is basically the mean plus two standard deviations,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.275
and the mean minus two standard deviations,

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:43.120
contains 95 percent of points,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.740
and this area contains 99 percent of points.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a quick look of how Gaussian distributions look in one dimension.
