00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
To do Gaussian mixture model clustering in two dimensions,

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:05.879
we'll need to a little bit of setup.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.910
So, assume we have two classes of students,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.195
2016 class and 2017 class.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.980
And they have different set of scores for the two tests, kind of like this.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.615
So each of these on its own is a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.509
This one, however, is a little bit rotated but it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.465
still a Gaussian distribution in two dimensions.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.940
Now, say that hackers broke into the school's systems,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.925
and removed the labels of these points,

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:38.149
effectively mixing the two datasets like this,

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.229
with no way to retrieve the original labels.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:48.769
And so, we ended up with this dataset that does not follow a Gaussian distribution,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.690
but we know that it's made up of two separate Gaussian distributions.

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.229
These are reasonable conditions for us to do

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.269
Gaussian mixture model clustering to try to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.130
retrieve the original two Gaussian distributions.
