00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
In this lesson, we'll look at two more clustering methods.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.330
The first one is called Hierarchical Clustering,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.705
and it results in a structure of clusters that gives us

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.484
a visual indication of how clusters relate to each other.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:16.649
And then, we'll look at Density-based Clustering.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.129
Specifically, we'll look at an algorithm called DBSCAN,

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:25.559
which stands for Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.469
which is robust against datasets with noise,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.660
and does not require us to specify a number of clusters.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.465
Basically, it clusters points that are densely packed together,

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.465
and labels other points as noise.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:44.070
And this is an algorithm that works really well on the two-crescent dataset.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.000
So, let's start by looking at hierarchical clustering in the next video.
