00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
Scikit-learn makes implementing DBSCAN a breeze.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:06.359
We just declare it here,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.350
we pass it epsilon and number of samples.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.695
There are default values if we don't declare them,

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:12.900
but this is how we do.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.865
And then we just pass the data set and say fit.

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:21.579
Db.labels now contains an array representing which cluster each point belongs to.

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.209
So, minus one is actually noise,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.714
but then zero, one,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.602
and two, and three, and so on, so forth,

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:32.100
these are the clusters that each point belongs to.
