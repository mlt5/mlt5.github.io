00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.009
There are a number of different use cases for PCA.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.750
You work through one example,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.199
where you reduce the dimensionality of image data to just over 10 features,

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.269
while still maintaining almost the same accuracy as when all the pixels were kept.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.629
PCA can be used anytime you want to reduce the dimensionality of your data or find

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:30.614
latent features that might encapsulate a number of other features into a single factor.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:35.129
Other specific situations of this include reducing the dimensionality of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
high-dimensional microarray data or finding latent features

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.854
related to survey data that can help find patterns and behavioral habits.

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:45.059
As more and more data are created,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.645
from YouTube videos, to car sensors,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:51.260
to text messages this technique can help transform data

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:56.449
down in a way that helps maximize the information from the original data.
