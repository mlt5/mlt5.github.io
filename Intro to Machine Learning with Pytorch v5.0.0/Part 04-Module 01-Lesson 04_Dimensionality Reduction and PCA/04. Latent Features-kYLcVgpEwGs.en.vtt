00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.115
To introduce PCA, let's consider an example.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:11.690
Here, we have a number of factors that are related to homes.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.844
But actually, there are two broad categories that these factors fall into.

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:19.310
The size of the house and the neighborhood that the house is in.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.719
These two factors are known as latent features.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.184
There are features that aren't directly in our dataset,

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:29.979
but encompass groupings of the features we have in our dataset.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.085
Surveys, often have questions that are related to latent features.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:36.535
Take a look at these survey questions,

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:41.259
can you identify which latent features are related to these questions?
