00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Nice job completing this lesson on PCA.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.079
This is not an easy topic to grasp,

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.464
so congratulations on making it this far.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.535
A ton was covered in this lesson.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.629
So I provided a text recap on the next page for you.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.224
In the final lesson,

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.340
you'll be learning about Independent Component Analysis or ICA from Jay.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.454
This is another unsupervised learning technique similar to PCA.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:33.265
He will be showing you a cool implementation of the technique involving a piano,

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.039
a cello, and a television.
