Scikit-learn makes it as easy to do GMM clustering as the other clustering methods which,

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:13.890
basically, we have to import the mixture library from scikit-learn and Gaussian mixture.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.900
And we handed the number of components,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.254
number of clusters we were after.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:19.890
We handed the dataset.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.484
It fits it, and then we can predict and get the labels for all the points,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.869
all the samples in our dataset
