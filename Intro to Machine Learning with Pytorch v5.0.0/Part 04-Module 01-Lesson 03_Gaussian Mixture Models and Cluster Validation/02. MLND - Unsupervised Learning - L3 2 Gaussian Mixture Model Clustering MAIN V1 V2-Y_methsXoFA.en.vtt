00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering is probably

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.514
the most advanced clustering method that we'll discuss.

00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:08.054
It is a clustering algorithm that assumes that

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:11.714
each cluster follows a certain statistical distribution.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:14.369
It uses a lot of what we know from probabilities and

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.579
statistics to come up with these clusters.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.354
You're probably familiar with the normal distribution,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.280
also called the Gaussian distribution.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.410
Many datasets that occur in real life can be

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.829
approximated by a Gaussian distribution like this.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.494
Test scores, for example,

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.054
the heights of people,

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:37.049
measurement error, are a few examples of things that follow a normal distribution.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:40.229
If you're not familiar with normal distributions, that's okay.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.000
We'll recap it quickly in the next video.
