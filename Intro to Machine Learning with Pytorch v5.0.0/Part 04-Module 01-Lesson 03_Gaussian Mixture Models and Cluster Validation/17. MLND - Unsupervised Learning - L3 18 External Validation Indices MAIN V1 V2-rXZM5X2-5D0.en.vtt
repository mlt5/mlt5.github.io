00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
External validation indices are

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.519
the scoring methods we use when we have a labeled datasets,

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.319
and we run a clustering on it.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.105
This is a subset of the scoring methods that we have available.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:13.766
This is not all of them,

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.960
this is just some of them, there are a lot more.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.664
Some of them are available in Scikit-learn as we'll see.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:20.744
And, each of these,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:27.495
we give them the original labels and the labels resulting from the clustering,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.880
and they give us a score in this range.

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.015
So, it's mostly in zero to one,

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:38.490
while Adjusted Rand Score gives us a range between minus one and one.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.020
Let's look at how Adjusted Rand Index is calculated.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.630
So, let's say we have this labeled datasets,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.880
and these are the actual labels.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.540
Let's say we run K-means or any other clustering methods on it,

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.490
and we get this clustering.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.855
So, it's not exactly the same as the actual label.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:00.944
So, let's first calculate the Rand Index,

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:04.439
and then calculate the Adjusted Rand Index.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.834
The formula for calculating the Rand Index is a plus b,

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.899
over n, choose two.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.600
a is the number of pairs that were in the same cluster

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.304
in C and remain to be in the same cluster in K,

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.315
the same cluster as each other,

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:23.164
regardless of the label of that cluster.

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:24.530
And so, let's count it here.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.579
So, we have these two,

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.659
or we have this pair that was in the same cluster in C,

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.149
and remains to be in the same cluster as each other in K. So that's one.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.800
And then, we have this pair.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.899
It was in the same cluster in C and remains to be in the same cluster in K,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.215
and then so that is two.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:50.564
Every pair including this point is discounted because it's switched.

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:56.670
So, we end up with a equal to 2. b is the number of pairs that were in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.808
different clusters in C and remain in different clusters in K. And so, let's count them.

00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:07.094
So, this pair was in different clusters in C,

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.949
and remains to be in different clusters in K. So, that's one.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.789
And then, we have this pair, these two points here.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:19.215
They were different in C, and they were different in K. So that's two.

00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:23.085
And then, these two as number three,

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:28.560
and these two, that is pair number four. And, that's it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.935
None of the pairs involving the central point can count.

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:34.305
So, b is equal to four.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:38.409
And n is basically the number of samples or points that we have.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.930
So that is just five.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.830
And so, that actually turns out to be just six over ten.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.035
That is the Rand Index.

00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:49.155
To calculate the Adjusted Rand Index,

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:51.735
we just discount the expected index.

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:56.390
There's a little bit more details about this calculation in the text below the video.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:02.229
Let's use Adjusted Rand Index to compare to K-means clusterings.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.774
Let's say we have this dataset,

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.560
and these are the original labels.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.360
We call them the ground truth.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.418
So, this is a labeled dataset that we have,

00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:13.180
and we run K-means one time,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.469
and we get this result.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.319
So, it's not perfectly matching the ground truth.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.259
So, these three points are purple here,

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.459
but they are orange here.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.980
So, it's not 100%,

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:29.019
it didn't get the actual labels 100% like the ground truth.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.540
But how much or how well did it do?

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.429
If we calculate the Adjusted Rand Index,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.335
it will be 0.84.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:39.150
Is that good? Is that bad?

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.530
I mean we can use that to compare.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.694
So, let's say we have another K-means clustering.

00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:48.854
But, let's say this one uses a different, maybe, initialization parameters,

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:52.185
it runs for a different number of iterations,

00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:56.354
and you can clearly see that it's different in a few ways.

00:03:56.354 --> 00:04:00.539
It's hard to tell just by looking which one is better.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:06.019
Better here means matching to the ground truth or the original labels of the dataset,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.265
but we can just simply calculate the Adjusted Rand Index,

00:04:09.264 --> 00:04:12.849
and that would turn out to be 0.86.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.909
And so, this has a higher score than this, and so,

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.159
this K-means clustering is better than this,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.548
or matches the ground truth better than this one does.

00:04:22.548 --> 00:04:25.000
And we can contrast that with a Random Assignment,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.764
where we have randomly or arbitrarily picked cluster for each of the points,

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:35.870
and the Adjusted Rand Index here would be very close to zero.
