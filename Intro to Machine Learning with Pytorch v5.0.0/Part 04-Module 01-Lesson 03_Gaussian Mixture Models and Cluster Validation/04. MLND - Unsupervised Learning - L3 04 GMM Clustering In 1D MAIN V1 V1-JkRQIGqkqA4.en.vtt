00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.365
In the previous video,

00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:05.805
we looked at this example of the results of a math test.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:08.175
Let's say, we have another test,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.580
let's say physics, where the results look like this,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.004
where this was definitely a difficult test with low mean and little variance in that,

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.929
and another test, let's say biology test,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.170
that looks like this.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.600
We can plot histograms for each of these two tests

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.234
and that would show us that they both follow Gaussian distributions,

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:34.799
but with different means and different variances,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.794
but they're both Gaussian.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:42.300
Say, we have this datasets and we want to do Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering on it.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.584
Let's say, we're going to pass this to Scikit-Learn and say,

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:49.785
"Okay, find this two clusters in here using Gaussian Mixture Models."

00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:52.125
Let's look at this dataset beforehand, though.

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.725
This dataset clearly does not follow one Gaussian distribution.

00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.975
That's because the dataset is actually a merger of these two datasets.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:04.545
Each one of them is a Gaussian, but together merged,

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.060
they are not one Gaussian,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.365
they're two Gaussians without their labels.

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:12.929
But Scikit-Learn does not know of that,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.990
we just hand it a list of points and say,

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:17.774
"Cluster them into two groups."

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:21.390
And the results would be these two clusters.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.275
Scikit-Learn was able to do that by finding this Gaussian Mixture distribution,

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:31.635
which is not a Gaussian model in itself,

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:34.230
but it's actually a mixture of two.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.685
So, this is one model that contains two Gaussians.

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:43.215
And whichever point seems to have the highest probability to have come from

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:49.015
each Gaussian is classified as belonging to a separate cluster.

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:52.400
And so, these points here were most likely generated by

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.910
this Gaussian so they belong to this cluster,

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.939
and these points were most likely generated

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.179
by this Gaussian and so they belong to this cluster.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.700
This example in one-dimension is probably

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.969
the simplest form of a Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.129
In the next video, we'll look at what

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.000
a Gaussian distribution looks like in two dimensions.
