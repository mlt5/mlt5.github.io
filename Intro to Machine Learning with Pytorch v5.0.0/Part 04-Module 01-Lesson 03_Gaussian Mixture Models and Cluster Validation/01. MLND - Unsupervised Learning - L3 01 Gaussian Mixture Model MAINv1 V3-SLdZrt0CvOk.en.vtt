00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
In this lesson we look at

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.224
one more clustering algorithm called Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering.

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:10.769
This is a soft clustering algorithm,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.554
which means that every point,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:16.664
every sample in our dataset will belong to every cluster that we have,

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:20.910
but would have different levels of membership in each cluster.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.140
So what Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering does is,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.060
it would look at the points that we have,

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.535
so let's look at this example in one dimensions.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:35.579
And it would say, "This set of points seems like it would have been generated by

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.299
a Gaussian distribution that looks like this," so I'll

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:43.530
give them the highest membership in this cluster.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.460
And these seem to have been generated by a Gaussian distribution that looks like this,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.935
and so I'll give them the highest membership in this cluster.

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.786
And this also works in two dimensions as well,

00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:58.079
and we'll talk about what it means to be

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.975
a Gaussian distribution in two or more dimensions as well.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:06.540
And this clustering algorithm works really well on this dataset that we looked at before.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.210
And then we'll look at the cluster analysis process.

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:12.964
So choosing the clustering algorithm is just only one step.

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.707
We have a number of steps to,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.250
hopefully, turn our data into knowledge.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.900
We'll talk about that process and how it goes

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.955
and then we'll end the lesson by talking about cluster validation,

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:29.015
which is how to score a clustering after we execute it.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:30.495
And, how do we compare

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.000
different clustering algorithms and their results on a certain dataset.
