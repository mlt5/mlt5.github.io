00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
Cluster validation is the procedure of evaluating

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.899
the results of a clustering objectively and quantitatively.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.595
There are three categories of cluster validation indices.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.730
The first are external indices.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.365
And these are the scoring methods that we use if our data was originally labeled.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:22.409
So, if we have a data set that is actually labelled,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.199
we can use external indices to score how a clustering method did.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.589
But most of the time,

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.539
the data that we have is not labelled specifically with unsupervised learning.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.126
And so these are the cases where internal indices can be helpful

00:00:38.127 --> 00:00:43.290
and these measure the fit between the data and structure using only the data.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.140
The third category is relative indices,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.560
and these indicate which of two clustering structures is better in some sense.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.770
Basically, all internal indices can serve as relative indices.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.650
Most validation indices are defined by compacting compactness and separability.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.439
Compactness is basically a measure of how

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.781
close the elements of a cluster are to each other,

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:13.129
while separability is how far or distinct clusters are from each other.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.435
The general assumption here is that

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:19.200
clustering methods are generally expected to produce clusters where

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.109
the elements of a cluster are the most similar to each

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.275
other and the clusters are the most distinct from each other.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.980
If this sounds a bit too theoretical, that's okay.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.000
We'll look at specific indices in the next videos.
