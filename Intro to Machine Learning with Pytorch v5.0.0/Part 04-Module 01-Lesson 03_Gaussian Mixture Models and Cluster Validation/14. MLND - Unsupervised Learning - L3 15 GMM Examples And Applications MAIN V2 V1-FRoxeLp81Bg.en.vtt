00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
GMM clustering is a powerful method.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.679
A couple of the advantages it gives us, is that one,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.184
it provides us with a soft clustering,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.796
so a sample membership of multiple clusterings.

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:17.384
And so that can be useful in cases where

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:21.750
you're for example let's say you're classifying documents

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.125
and you want each document to be part of

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:30.615
multiple topics or multiple categories and so that's useful in those scenarios.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:36.765
But in addition to that, it also gives us flexibility in the shapes of clusters.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.210
So like the example we looked at,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.884
a cluster can contain another cluster inside of it.

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.375
On the other hand in terms of disadvantages,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.725
GMM clustering is sensitive to initialization values.

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:55.020
It's possible to converge to a local optimum and it's a slow convergence rate.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.455
Otherwise, it's a pretty useful and strong and powerful clustering algorithm

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:05.340
as we'll see in the couple of the applications that we'll look at.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.564
So the first application we'll look at is this really cool paper,

00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:15.064
which uses GMM clustering or Gaussian Mixture Models specifically,

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:18.920
to make sense of a vast number of sensor readings.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.469
And so one dataset that it looks at is accelerometer reading.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.750
And so let's say you give people accelerometers to carry in their pockets and then

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.405
you get the readings and you try to make sense of those readings.

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:39.439
Gaussian Mixture Models were useful here in terms of creating

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.370
a vocabulary of what different activities look like.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.829
And so commuting looks sort of like this,

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.974
and office work looks like this,

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:52.679
and these can be estimated by Gaussian mixtures,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.130
so you can learn them and then you can use them to

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:01.004
identify the different activities just based on the accelerometer reading.

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:08.549
The paper also has another dataset of velocity so this is based on GPS readings.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.805
And so using those GPS readings and using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering,

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:20.270
you can detect when people are using bikes or moving in a bike,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.045
or in a bus, or in a subway,

00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:25.429
based on estimating and finding out and learning

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.569
basically a Gaussian Mixture Model for what that activity looks like.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.329
So this is the velocity and this would be the density.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.036
So when you're riding a bike,

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:40.310
most of the time you're at this speed of let's say two or three meters per second,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.875
and so that's the spike there.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:46.879
And so I highly recommend reading this paper and looking

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.870
at how they utilize GMMs in this application.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:59.039
It's also useful to use Gaussian mixture models to classify Pulsar stars in astronomy.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.150
That's a common usage,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.987
you'll find number of papers,

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:03.615
this is one of them.

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:09.060
Gaussian Mixture Models have also been used for a long time in biometrics.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.170
So speaker verification, this is one example as a paper,

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.099
but it's also been used to identify signatures of people,

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.835
fingerprints, and a number of other sort of biometrics.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:24.300
I would say that by far the coolest the uses

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.820
for Gaussian Mixture Models are in computer vision.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.259
And this is one example.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.724
So this is a model that we feed this picture to,

00:03:31.724 --> 00:03:35.729
and we also feed this streaming video to.

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.000
And what it does is it detects the background

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.419
and subtracts it from the initial image here.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.264
So what this does is actually it gives each pixel a Gaussian Mixture Model,

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:51.839
and then uses this streaming video to learn a model,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.870
a Gaussian mixture for what actually happens in that pixel across multiple frames,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.849
and then using that it can detect the background.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.000
So the background we can basically identify it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.419
as the element that's common in maybe in most,

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.894
not all, but maybe most of the frames.

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:15.850
So once we identify it we can identify

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.045
what is in the foreground and then we can subtract it from the top here.

00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:20.439
So if we roll it back here,

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:25.254
you can see how we have this cars here and then slowly as we learn the model,

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:27.189
we can make them disappear.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.649
So we have identified what is a background in

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:32.620
what is a foreground and so we can do something cool like this.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.375
This is a different paper,

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.879
but it does pretty much the same thing.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.050
This is also background subtraction using Gaussian mixture models.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.415
So here, once we identify the background, we subtract it.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:50.590
And so what we're left with is the objects in the foreground.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.539
So we can use it to track people,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.655
identify things that are moving in a camera feed let's say here.

00:04:57.654 --> 00:05:03.069
And so these and other example papers are linked in the text below.
