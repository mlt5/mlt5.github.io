00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
All right. In lesson one,

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.740
we figured out how to work with remote repositories.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.179
In lesson two, we looked at how to start developing on a shared repository.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.330
Now, let's look at how to sync our new changes back to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.189
our forked remote repository and how to

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.429
retrieve updates from the original source repository.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.379
Some things we'll look at in this lesson are,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.928
learning what a pull request is and how to make one,

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:24.789
retrieving updates that have been made in

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.140
the source repository and including them in our fork,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.870
working with an active pull request,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.600
squashing commits with git rebase and more.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.300
Let's start out by looking what a pull request is and how to create one.
