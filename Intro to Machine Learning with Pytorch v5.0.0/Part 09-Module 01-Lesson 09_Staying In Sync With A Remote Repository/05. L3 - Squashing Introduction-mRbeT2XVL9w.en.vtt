00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
The git rebase comment is a tricky beast.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.870
If you do a search for it on the web you'll see a lot of warnings

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.995
about how this command is dangerous and can destroy your repository.

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.160
And that isn't a surefire way to prevent you from trying it out,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.810
I don't know what is.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.600
The truth is the tool is powerful and can

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.825
wipe out a chunk of your repository in just a few steps,

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:25.629
but it's not as dangerous as you've been led to believe.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.570
It's almost impossible to destroy a git repository when you're using the git commands.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.334
We'll be using git rebase to do something called squashing.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:39.850
Squashing is just taking a number of commits and combining them into one single commit.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.270
Let's say that you've been working on a new feature in

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.685
the last three commits you had were all little typo changes.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:47.730
With git rebase, you can combine

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.599
these three commits into one larger commit. Let's take a look.
