With Josh, you will learn about considerations in the design of visualizations, to make sure that the visualizations you create are as effective and interpretable as possible. And with Mike, you will learn about how to implement visualizations using Python, and how you can learn about your data from them.\n\nThe rest of this lesson will go into more details about the place of data visualization in the data analysis process. You will also be briefly introduced to the packages that will be used later in the course and get an outline of the topics that we will cover.",

You are the consumer of these plots, and you need to be able to find the answer to your questions from these plots.<br><br>\n\n2. **Explanatory** analysis is done when you are providing your results for others.  These visualizations need to provide you the emphasis necessary to convey your message.  They should be accurate, insightful, and visually appealing.  \n\nThe five steps of the data analysis process:\n\n1. **Extract** - Obtain the data from a spreadsheet, SQL, the web, etc.<br><br>\n2. **Clean** - Here we could use expl**or**atory visuals.<br><br>\n3. **Explore** - Here we use expl**or**atory visuals.<br><br>\n4. **Analyze** - Here we might use either expl**or**atory or expl**an**atory visuals.<br><br>\n5. **Share** - Here is where expl**an**atory visuals live.\n\n",

For clarity, as of August 2018, here are the library versions that were used to create the course materials:\n- **NumPy**: Workspaces use v1.12.1, content created with v1.14.0\n- **pandas**: Workspaces use v0.20.3, content created with v0.22.0\n- **Matplotlib**: Workspaces use v2.1.0, content created with v2.1.2\n- **Seaborn**: Workspaces and content both created with v0.8.1",

Below is a summary of topics that will be covered in the remaining lessons in this course.\n\n### Lesson 2: Design of Visualizations\n\nBefore getting into the actual creation of visualizations later in the course, this lesson introduces design principles that will be useful both in exploratory and explanatory analysis. You will learn about different data types and ways of encoding data. You will also learn about properties of visualizations that can impact both the clarity of messaging as well as their accuracy.\n\n### Lessons 3-5: Exploration of Data\n\nThese lessons systematically present core visualizations in exploratory data analysis. Exploration starts with univariate visualizations to identify trends in distribution and outliers in single variables. Bivariate visualizations follow, to show relationships between variables in the data. Finally, multivariate visualization techniques are presented to identify complex relationships between three or more variables at the same time.\n\n### Lesson 6: Explanatory Visualizations\n\nThis lesson describes considerations that should be made when moving from exploratory data analysis to explanatory analysis. When polishing visualizations to present to others, you will need to consider what findings you want to focus on and how to use visualization techniques to highlight your main story. This lesson also provides tips for presentation of results and how to iterate on your presentations.\n\n### Lesson 7: Visualization Case Study\n\nIn this lesson, you will bring together everything from the previous lessons in an example case study. You will be presented with a dataset and perform an exploratory analysis. You will then take findings from that analysis and polish them up for presentation as explanatory visualizations.",
