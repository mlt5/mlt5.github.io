00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.019
OK, so now maybe we've made a
bunch of files and directories

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.929
and stuff, and we want to clean
them up to delete some things.

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:10.109
Well, the Shell command
for deleting files

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.279
is rm, which is
short for remove.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.149
rm works the same
as you'd probably

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.129
expect from other
Shell commands,

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.399
you just give it the name of the
file, or the names of the files

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.250
that you want to remove.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.199
Now, I've got to give
you a safety warning.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.939
In your GUI, you've probably
got a trash can or recycle bin

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.009
where files go when you
want to get rid of them,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.799
but you can take them back
out if you change your mind.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.289
The rm command does
not work like this.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.539
It just removes the files.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.390
If you want a
little more warning,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
maybe you're afraid you
might remove a valuable file

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.549
by mistake, well, you
can use the option -I.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.250
The I is for interactive,
which will prompt you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.539
for every file it's
going to remove.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.049
Now for directories, there's
a different command, which

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.097
is rmdir for remove directory.
