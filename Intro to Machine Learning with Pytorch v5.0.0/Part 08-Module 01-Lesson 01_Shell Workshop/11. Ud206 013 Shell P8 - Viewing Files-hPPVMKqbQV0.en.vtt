00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Now we know how to get files from off the web.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.040
But what can we do with them once we have them?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.340
Well, there's a shell command called cat

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.250
that just reads the file and outputs the contents.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.290
Actually, it can read any number of files.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.465
The name cat is short for Catenate

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:19.725
or Concatenate which means to run several things together.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:23.590
So let's try that. Cat dictionary.txt.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.945
Went straight to zucchinis and zwieback and zygote.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.685
That's not very useful if we wanted to see the top of the file.

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:34.550
It just blasted the file at our terminal so quick that it went right to the end.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.575
Fortunately, there's another program,

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:40.255
less, which shows us less of the file at once.

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:44.120
Specifically, it'll just show you one screenful of the file at a time.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.880
You press space to scroll down or you can use the arrow keys.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.760
It has some other commands like B to go back or slash to search.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.080
When you're done in less,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.160
you can press Q to quit.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.860
And less is really handy.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.680
It's used internally by a lot of other programs that might

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.330
sometimes need to display a lot of output and give you a chance to catch up.
