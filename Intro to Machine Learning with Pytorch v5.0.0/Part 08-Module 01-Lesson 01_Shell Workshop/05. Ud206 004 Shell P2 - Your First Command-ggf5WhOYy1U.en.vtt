00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.250
So here we are in a terminal.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.540
Inside the terminal window,
we see a little message here,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.419
and another message
here, and a cursor.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.390
Now, this message
is the Shell prompt.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.730
It usually displays some
information about the computer

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.289
you're logged into.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.910
Exactly what
message you see here

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.559
will depend on your system.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.479
Later on, we'll see
how to change it.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.719
If you type something in at the
Shell prompt and press Enter,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.189
the Shell will try
to run whatever

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.770
you typed as a command.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.519
Throughout this course,
you'll be learning

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.259
a bunch of Shell commands.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.129
Here's the first one.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.280
The echo command is how we get
the Shell to print messages

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.600
back to us.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.890
It's like console.log in
JavaScript or Print in Python.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.340
Try it out.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.220
OK, what happens if I
want the greeting to be

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.350
a little bit more enthusiastic?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.929
Hello, shello followed
by two exclamation marks.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.630
Huh, that's weird.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.920
Hello, shello echo.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.216
Hello, shello.

00:00:58.216 --> 00:00:59.512
Hello, shello echo.

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:00.280
Hello, shello.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.350
Hey, if I said that a
bunch of times in a row

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.950
that could be a number one jam.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.120
Hello, shello echo.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.980
Hello, shello.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.189
Hello, shello echo.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.509
Hello, shello.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.700
The point being, there
are some characters

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.100
that have a special
meaning to the Shell.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.353
The exclamation
mark is one of them.

00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:19.269
If you're ever typing
something into the Shell

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:23.310
and it seems to be treating what
you're saying in a weird way,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.620
all you usually need to do is
to put single quotes around it.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.540
Huh, there we go.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.300
That's a little bit
less repetitive.
