00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.380
Take a look at these points here.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.750
You can see that even without labels,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.500
there are ways that we might group these points together.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.484
In this particular plot,

00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:16.730
it appears that there are two groups.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.969
Now, look at this set of points here.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:25.184
Here, it appears that the points in this plot can be grouped into three groups.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:28.500
If we were to add a new point say here,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
we could easily say that it is similar to the rest of these points.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.250
Similarly, if we were to add a point say here,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.719
we could see that it belongs to this group.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.950
Grouping data together in this way is known as clustering.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.135
This is the first type of unsupervised machine learning that we'll look at.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:50.349
Take a look at these points here,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.450
notice how they follow a pattern.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.640
Another type of unsupervised learning,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.734
we can use patterns in our points to reduce the dimensionality.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.115
So in this case,

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:03.090
we could reduce from two dimensions to one.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.215
This is a second type of unsupervised learning called dimensionality reduction.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:11.260
Throughout this course, you will get some practice with

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.390
each of these two types of unsupervised learning.
