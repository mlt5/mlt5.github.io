00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
In the next few years, software developers will need to know how to

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.590
incorporate deep learning models into everyday applications.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.960
Anything with a camera will be using an image classification,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.910
object detection, and face recognition,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.165
and so on, all based on deep learning models.

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.550
For is user interfaces like Alexa, Cortana,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.390
and Google Assistant all powered by

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.950
speech recognition models will become more and more common.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.830
So, in this project,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.870
you'll be implementing an image classification application.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.040
This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.175
then use the trained model to classify images.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.400
First, you'll develop your code in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.510
a Jupiter notebook to make sure your training implementation works.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.110
Then, you'll convert the code to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.580
a Python application that runs from the command line. Good luck.
