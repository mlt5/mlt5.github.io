00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.815
Before we get too far on this journey,

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:07.160
let's talk about setting up your computer to complete this Nanodegree program.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.535
In this lesson, we'll walk you through installing Anaconda with Python three,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.859
which will use throughout the classroom.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.894
Additionally, we have some notes on installing different text editors.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.009
I personally use Atom.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.905
However, you can use any text editor you think is best for you.

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:28.490
Matt and I will be teaming up to show you the different workflows we recommend,

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.945
as they're most common in industry.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.975
If you already have your machine setup the way you like,

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:36.375
feel free to skip this whole lesson.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.310
If you're setting up your computer for

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.980
the first time and get stuck on any part of this lesson,

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.719
reach out for help on Slack,

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.484
and we'll help you get through.

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:50.429
Don't worry, you'll be able to work through the program as you continue to get setup.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.460
There are workspaces available in the classroom to get through

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.575
the program if you don't want to do the work locally.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.880
However, we strongly recommend getting the setup on your local computer,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.890
as it will prepare you for working in industry.
