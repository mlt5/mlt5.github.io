00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
Of course, in reality,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.195
we don't know whether a person suffers cancer,

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:07.400
but we can run a test, like a blood test.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.805
And the outcome of the blood test may be positive or negative.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:13.500
But like any good test,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.815
it tells me something about the thing I really care about,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.820
whether the person is cancerous or not.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.040
So, let's say, if the person has the cancer,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.301
the test comes up positive with a probability of 0.9.

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:30.870
And that implies, if the person has cancer,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.900
the negative outcome would have a 0.1 probability.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.720
And that's because these two things have to add up to one.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.780
I've just given you a fairly complicated notation that says,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.780
the outcome of the test depends on whether the person has cancer or not.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.220
That is more complicated than everything else we talked about so far.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.600
We call this thing over here a conditional probability.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.805
And the way to understand this is very funny notation.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:03.700
There's a bar in the middle.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.905
And the bar says,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.855
what's the probability of the stuff on the left,

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:11.960
given that we assume the stuff in the right is actually the case?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.775
Now, in reality, we don't know whether the person has cancer or not.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.475
And in a later unit,

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:23.000
we're going to reason about whether the person has cancer given a certain dataset.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.690
But for now, we assume we have got like capabilities,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.930
that can tell with absolute certainty whether the person has cancer,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.770
and we can determine what the outcome of the test is.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.095
This is a test that isn't exactly deterministic.

00:01:38.095 --> 00:01:39.525
It makes mistakes.

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:43.035
But it only makes a mistake in 10% of the cases,

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.668
as illustrated by 0.1 down here.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:46.875
Now it turns out,

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:51.150
I haven't fully specified the test.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.345
The same test might also be applied to a situation where the person does not have cancer.

00:01:57.345 --> 00:02:02.424
So, this little thing over here is my shortcut of not having cancer.

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.190
And now, let me say the probability of the test,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.265
giving me a positive results,

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:09.575
a false positive result,

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:13.015
when there's no cancer is 0.2.

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.640
You can now tell me,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.070
what's the probability of a negative outcome,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.755
in case we know for a fact the person doesn't have cancer.

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.000
So please tell me.
