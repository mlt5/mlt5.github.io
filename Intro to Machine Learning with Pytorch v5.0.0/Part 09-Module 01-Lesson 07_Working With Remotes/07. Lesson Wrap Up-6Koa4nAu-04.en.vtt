00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
Understanding what a remote repository is and how to get and send changes to one,

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.099
is at the heart of working collaboratively.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.459
We looked at GIT remote to manage a remote repository,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.966
GIT push to send the changes,

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:18.030
GIT fetch to retrieve updates and GIT pull to

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.554
retrieve updates and automatically merge those changes into a local branch.

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:26.734
Now that we have the solid foundation of working with remotes,

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:30.000
let's start working with another developer's repository.
