00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Our local repository has five commits,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.969
and the remote one has the six commits.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:10.803
The local repository has the origin/master branch point to e,

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:14.445
but in the remote the master branch is actually one commit ahead of

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:18.940
e. Since the remote's master is pointing to commit seven,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.530
these two repositories are out of sync.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.839
We need to sync our local one with what's up on the remote.

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:29.908
To do that we'd run "git pull," the name of the remote,

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:34.954
in this case "origin," and then the branch to pull, "master".

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:36.710
This will pull down the commits on

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.495
the origin's master branch and merge them into our local master branch,

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:43.089
which just moves it forward.
