00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.745
We have our local repository down here and a remote repository up here.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:10.250
Our local repository has these commits on the master branch,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.574
but the remote repository is completely empty.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:19.939
Now, how do we get these commits from our local repository up into the remote repository?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.790
We can do that with the git push command.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.894
That will take all of the commits from the local repository

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:30.000
and send or push them up to the remote.
