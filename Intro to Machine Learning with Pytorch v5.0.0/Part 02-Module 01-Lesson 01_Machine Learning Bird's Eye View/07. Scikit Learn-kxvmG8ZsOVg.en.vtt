00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:07.330
If you're interested in

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.990
solving machine learning questions that fall into either supervised,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.679
or unsupervised learning, the most popular open-source

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.855
library in the world for solving these problems is scikit-learn.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.289
Scikit-learn, provides any data scientist the ability to use

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.928
the most advanced techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning easily,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.329
and for a variety of situations.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.629
You can expect that scikit-learn will continue to

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.695
be used for machine learning in both industry,

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:40.835
and academia for the foreseeable future.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.579
In the following lessons,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.489
you will get comfortable solving a range of problems using this library.
