There's no penalty for submitting late projects, and you can submit a project multiple times to pass. We strongly suggest that you try to submit a final solution by the listed deadline. This allows you to benefit from progressing with your classmates; also, we see that students who submit the first two projects on time have a much higher chance of completing the program as a whole!\n* **If a student has not passed all three projects by the end of program deadline, they may have to re-enroll with the next class of students for the full program price.**\n\n---\n\n\n",

We'll go over the main metrics used for evaluating models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Then, we'll learn about common **supervised learning algorithms**, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, naive Bayes, neural networks, and support vector machines. We'll also learn to combine these algorithms to achieve their full potential, in the ensemble methods section. Every section is equipped with a lab, where you'll get to apply your knowledge using sklearn.\n\n### Deep  Learning\n\nIn this section, we'll be learning the foundational math and theory behind **neural networks** that can learn to find patterns in some given data. You'll implement backpropagation and optimization using numpy to get an understanding of neural networks, then build up to training neural networks using the deep learning framework, PyTorch. You'll see how to build your own image classifier in Pytorch.\n\n### Unsupervised Learning\n\nIn this section, we'll be going over the main **unsupervised learning algorithms**, including several clustering methods, and dimensionality reduction. Unsupervised learning is all about finding groupings in data without specific metrics, like accuracy, to aim for; it is also used heavily in reducing the dimensionality of data. You'll go through several mini-projects and labs in which you'll be able to apply these concepts with real data.",

Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will develop and demonstrate specific skills that will serve you for a lifetime. Congratulations on taking the first step towards developing the skills you need to power your career through tech education!\n \nThe videos, text lessons, and quizzes you encounter in the classroom are optional but recommended. In order to graduate, you need to pass every project. Projects will test your ability to apply the skills and strategies you have learned in the classroom to real-world problems. They will also provide tangible outputs you can use to demonstrate your skills for current and future employers.\n \nProjects are designed to be challenging. Many students initially struggle, but with a little grit they are able to learn from their mistakes and build their skills. Data from nearly 100,000 Udacity graduates show that commitment and persistence are the highest predictors of whether or not a student will graduate. \n \nAt some point, nearly every student will get stuck on a new concept or skill, and doubt may set in. Don’t panic. Don’t quit. Be patient, and work through the problem. Remember that you are not alone and the problem that you are encountering is likely one that many others have experienced as well. Whether you are stuck or simply looking for encouragement, you’ll find Udacity Mentors and students there to help.\n",

But consider using bullet points to separately list each of the questions in your post. Keeping your questions organized helps ensure mentors provide clear answers to each specific question. If your questions are less closely connected, it’s best to submit new, separate questions for each one.        \n\n\n- __Provide Details and Links:__ explaining what (if anything) you’ve already attempted to solve the problem helps mentors know where to start when answering your question. Likewise, if your question is not related specifically to a project, but rather to an exercise, quiz, or lesson, it’s helpful to include information such as lesson or quiz name, screenshots, and classroom links.  \n\n> Overall the key to asking a good question is to imagine yourself trying to answer your own question. Imagine you were coming to it without any prior knowledge. Does the question make complete sense? Or are there gaps around the context?    \n\n\n- __Start with a Clear Question Title__: attempt to summarize your entire question in one sentence. You may even write the title at the end, just before posting the question. This will help you summarize the issue before you include details in the question itself.      \n\n\n- __Share Code Correctly__:  by using the “Code Block” option to properly format your code. If your question concerns a piece of external code, include a link to the file on Github.    \n\n> In fact, Github lets you create a link to a specific line in a file.  To do so, just click to the left of the line number, and then select _copy permalink_ in the ellipsis that appears in the margin. Paste the _permalink_ right into the Github box on your question submission form.       \n\n\n- __Figuring out Errors__: if your question is about an error message or stack trace, include the entire error message, by either formatting the error message using the “Code Block” option or creating a Gist or a Paste on Pastebin, and including a link to it in the description.    \n\n\n- __Avoid Screenshots of Code or Error Messages__: do not use screenshots of code or error messages. They are hard to read and the text cannot be copied to debug it.   \n\n\n\nIf you receive a helpful answer, kindly select it as the “accepted answer.” For questions from other students, if you see other helpful answers kindly select the “upvote” option. Conversely, if you don’t think an answer strongly answers a question, select the “downvote” option. ",
