We will walk you through all the details, so don't worry if you have never used it before!  If you would like to learn or refresh on command lines, we strongly recommend going through this free [Shell Workshop](http://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206) lesson, where you can set up and learn how to use Unix Shell commands.\n\n### ** Note to Windows Users: Install Git Bash\nAs noted in the free Shell Workshop linked above, we recommend you install Git Bash [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use this as your terminal for this lesson. *Please note that during installation you should select the checkbox* **Use Git and Optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt**. This will allow you to use Unix commands while in Windows. If you'd rather use PowerShell, those commands are also provided in this lesson. For more information on the different command shells, check out the Shell Workshop lesson linked above.\n\n## 2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?\nIn this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3. Although Python 2 is still being used in many places, it is no longer being updated. In order to keep up compatibility with future improvements to Python, we recommend using Python 3.\n\nMac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python. However, it shouldn't do any harm to your system to install Python 3 separately, too.\n\nWindows doesn't usually come with Python included, but you can still check whether you have it installed before going ahead. So, first, check that you’ve not already got Python 3 installed.\n\nOpen up your Terminal or Command Line (this would be Git Bash on Windows).\n\nIn a new terminal or command prompt, type\n```bash\n$ python --version\n```\nand press `Enter`.\n\nYou might get a response that the Python version installed is something like `Python 2.7.9`. In that case, it would tell you that you have Python 2 installed, and you'll want to follow the steps in the next couple of sections to update it to Python 3.\n\nIf instead the version number starts with a 3, then you already have Python 3 installed! Don't install Python again! \n\nAlternatively, you might see an error message - don't worry about that for now, just try the steps in the next couple of sections.",

It's simple to install packages with Anaconda and create virtual environments to work on multiple projects conveniently. \n\n\nEven if you already have Python installed, it will be beneficial to use Anaconda/Miniconda because:\n1. Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages; you'll be all set to start working with data. \n2. Using `conda` to manage your packages and environments will reduce future issues dealing with the various libraries you'll be using.\n\n\n## Python Packages\nA package is a bunch of modules, where each module consists of a set of classes and function definitions. After installing a particular package, you can `import` and use the functions defined in that package. \n\nIf we install Anaconda, then a basic few packages are installed by default. However, you can install any more packages, if needed.  \n\n## Anaconda Distribution\nAnaconda is a fairly large download (~500 MB) because it comes with Python's most common data science packages. [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/overview/) is a software distribution that includes the following:\n\n* **Anaconda Navigator** - It is a graphical user interface that helps open up any installed applications, such as Jupyter notebook or VS code editor. We will learn more about the notebook in the next lesson. See a snapshot of Anaconda Navigator below:\n",

Your first command should be \n```\nconda --version\n```\nIf you are not comfortable on the command line, check out the [command prompt tutorial for Windows](https://www.lynda.com/-tutorials/Windows-command-line-basics/497312/513424-4.html) or our [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595) course for OSX/Linux.\n\n* **Python** - The latest version of Python gets installed as an individual package. \n* Over 160 scientific packages and their dependencies are also installed. \n\nIf you don't need all the packages or need to conserve bandwidth or storage space,  there is an option for you -  **Miniconda**.\n\n--- \n\n## Miniconda\n**Either Anaconda or Miniconda is adequate for this course.** [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a smaller distribution as compared to Anaconda, which includes only `conda` and Python. Miniconda can do everything Anaconda is capable of, but **doesn't have the preinstalled packages**. You can still install any of the available packages using `conda install PACKAGENAME` on the terminal/Anaconda Prompt. Interestingly, you can anytime upgrade from Miniconda to Anaconda by using the command:\n```\nconda install anaconda\n```\nIn the command above, did you notice that we followed the same `conda install PACKAGENAME` syntax? See an example below to install the Numpy package with conda on the Terminal/Anaconda Prompt. You will see a demonstration soon after understanding the setup. \n\n--- \n\n## Overview - Managing Packages using either `pip` or `conda`\n",

However, the `pip` also comes preinstalled with the Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4. \n\nIn case if you have Anaconda/Miniconda already installed, and don't have `pip` in your system, there are two ways:\n\n1.

We will see commands for this step on the very next page because we will learn to install Anaconda/Miniconda next. \n\n\n### Which one should I prefer - `pip` or `conda`?\nThere are two points you can consider before making a choice:\n1. The available packages available from the Anaconda distribution in `conda` focus on data science, whereas `pip` is for general use. Conda installs precompiled packages. For example, the Anaconda distribution comes with Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit-learn compiled with the [MKL library](https://docs.continuum.io/mkl-optimizations/), speeding up various math operations. **But, sometimes, you may need packages other than the ones listed on the Anaconda distribution.**\n2. Pip can install both Python and non-Python packages. Pip can install any package listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI). \n\n**You can (and will) still use `pip` alongside `conda` to install packages.**\n\n--- \n\n## Environments\nA Python environment comprises a particular version of each of the following:\n* Python interpreter, \n* Python-packages, and\n* The utility scripts, such as pip.  \nIt is possible to have two or more environments residing on the same computer *virtually*.

It's similar to [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv), other popular environment managers. \n\n### Why do  you need a Virtual Environment?\nEach virtual environment remains isolated from other virtual environments, and the default “system”  environment.  **Environments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects.** Often you’ll be working with code that depends on different versions of some library. For example, you could have code that uses new features in Numpy, or code that uses old features that have been removed. It’s practically impossible to have two versions of Numpy installed at once. Instead, you should make an environment for each version of Numpy then work in the appropriate environment for the project.\n\nThis issue also happens a lot when dealing with Python 2 and Python 3. You might be working with old code that doesn’t run in Python 3 and new code that doesn’t run in Python 2. Having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. It’s much better to have separate environments.\n\nYou can also export the list of packages in an environment to a file, then include that file with your code. This allows other people to easily load all the dependencies for your code. Pip has similar functionality with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.\n\n## Where we go from here\nNext, I'll get into the details of using Anaconda. First I'll cover installing it, then using the package manager, and finally creating and managing environments.\n",

Download the installer from  [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Choose the Python 3.7 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer. If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.\n\n\n2. Refer the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)\n\n3. Verify the installation [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/) for your respective OS\n\n\n\nAfter installation, you’re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed which you can see below. You can check out your own install by entering the following command into your terminal.\n```\nconda list\n```\n\n<video loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_default_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n\n## List of Applications Installed with Anaconda\nAs we read on the previous page, the following packages will get installed with Anaconda:\n* **Anaconda Navigator** - a GUI for managing your environments and packages\n* **`conda`** - a command-line utility\n* **Python** - The latest version of Python gets installed as an individual package. \n* **Anaconda Prompt** - [Only for Windows] a terminal where you can use the command-line interface to manage your environments and packages\n* A bunch of applications, such as **Spyder**. It is an IDE geared toward scientific development. In total, over 160 scientific packages and their dependencies are also installed. \n\n\n\n\nTo avoid errors later, it's best to update all the packages in the default environment. Open the Terminal/ Anaconda Prompt application. In the prompt, run the following commands:\n\n    conda upgrade conda\n    conda upgrade --all\n\nand answer yes when asked if you want to install the packages. The packages that come with the initial install tend to be out of date, so updating them now will prevent future errors from out of date software.\n\n>**Note:** In the previous step, running `conda upgrade conda` should not be necessary because `--all` includes the conda package itself, but some users have encountered errors without it.\n\n---\n \nIn the rest of this lesson, you'll learn to use commands in your Terminal/Anaconda Prompt. I highly suggest you start working with command-line utility first, then later use the GUI if you'd like. Once you get acquainted with the command-line utility, refer to the [Starter Guide for Anaconda distribution (GUI)](https://docs.anaconda.com/_downloads/9ee215ff15fde24bf01791d719084950/Anaconda-Starter-Guide.pdf).\n\n## Troubleshooting Resources\nIf you are facing difficulty in installing and running conda, refer to the FAQ - [Should I add Anaconda to the macOS/Linux/Windows PATH?](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/). Additionally, the following links might be useful:\n1. Linux/macOS - \n * If you are seeing the \"conda command not found\" and are using ZShell, you have to add `export PATH=\"/Users/USERNAME/opt/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"` to your .zsh_config file.\n\n2. Windows users - \n * ['export' is not recognized as an internal or external command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26368306/export-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)\n * ['Conda' is not recognized as internal or external command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44515769/conda-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command)\n",

              "text": "# Managing Packages\n\n## Install Packages\nOnce you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To install a package, type the following command in your terminal. \n```\nconda install PACKAGE_NAME\n```\nFor example, to install numpy, type `conda install numpy`.\n\n<video controls loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\nYou can install multiple packages at the same time. For example, the command below will install all three packages simultaneously.\n```\nconda install numpy scipy pandas\n```\nIt's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number such as `conda install numpy=1.10`.\n\nConda also automatically installs dependencies for you. For example `scipy` uses and requires `numpy`. If you install just `scipy` (`conda install scipy`), Conda will also install `numpy` if it isn't already installed.\n\n## Remove Packages\nMost of the commands are pretty intuitive. To uninstall, use \n```\nconda remove PACKAGE_NAME\n``` \n\n## Update Packages\nTo update a package, use \n```\nconda update package_name\n``` \nIf you want to update all packages in an environment, which is often useful, use `conda update --all`. And finally, to list installed packages, it's `conda list` which you've seen before.\n\n## Search a Package to Install\nIf you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can try searching with `conda search *SEARCH_TERM*`. For example, I know I want to install [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but I'm not sure of the exact package name. So, I try `conda search *beautifulsoup*`. Note that your shell might expand the wildcard `*` before running the conda command. To fix this, wrap the search string in single or double quotes like `conda search '*beautifulsoup*'`.\n",

You should write Python code for version 3. Read more [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).\n\n## The main breakage between Python 2 and 3\n\nFor the most part, the Python 2 code will work with Python 3. Of course, most new features introduced with Python 3 versions won't be backward compatible. The place where your Python 2 code will fail most often is the `print` statement. See the change in the syntax below:\n\n```python\n# Print statement in Python 2\nprint \"Hello\", \"world!\"\n\n# Print statement in Python 3\nprint(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n```\n    \nIf you want your `print()` function to work in both Python 2 and 3 versions, you'll need to import the `print_function` in your Python 2.6+ code. The `print()` function was backported to Python 2.6+ through the `__future__` module:\n```python\n# Python 3 `print()` function can run in Python 2.6+ after an `import` statement.\n# In Python 2.6+\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nprint(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n\n# Python 2 `print` statement cannot run in Python 3.\n# The following line of code will NOT work in Python 3\nprint \"Hello\", \"world!\"\n```\n",

              "text": "# What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n\nWelcome to this lesson on using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. For example, here's one of my favorite notebooks shared recently, [binary black hole signals in LIGO open data](https://www.gw-openscience.org/GW150914data/LOSC_Event_tutorial_GW150914.html) detected by the [LIGO experiment](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211). You could download the data, run the code in the notebook, and repeat the analysis, in effect detecting the gravitational waves yourself! You can view a few more tutorial notebooks at [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center homepage](https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/).\n\n\nNotebooks have quickly become an essential tool when working with data. You'll find them being used for [data cleaning and exploration](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jmsteinw/Notebooks/blob/master/IndeedJobs.ipynb), visualization, [machine learning](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/masinoa/machine_learning/blob/master/04_Neural_Networks.ipynb), and [big data analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tdhopper/rta-pyspark-presentation/blob/master/slides.ipynb). Here's [an example notebook](https://github.com/mcleonard/blog_posts/blob/master/body_fat_percentage.ipynb) I made for my personal blog that shows off many of the features of notebooks. Typically you'd be doing this work in a terminal, either the normal Python shell or with IPython. Your visualizations would be in separate windows, any documentation would be in separate documents, along with various scripts for functions and classes. However, with notebooks, all of these are in one place and easily read together.\n\nNotebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub. It’s a great feature that lets you easily share your work. There is also http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ that renders the notebooks from your GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere.   ",

With literate programming, the documentation is written as a narrative alongside the code instead of sitting off by its own. In Donald Knuth's words, \n\n> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\n\nAfter all, code is written for humans, not for computers. Notebooks provide exactly this capability. You are able to write documentation as narrative text, along with code. This is not only useful for the people reading your notebooks, but for your future self coming back to the analysis. \n\nJust a small aside: recently, this idea of literate programming has been extended to a whole programming language, [Eve](http://www.witheve.com/).",

IPython is an interactive shell, similar to the normal Python shell but with great features like syntax highlighting and code completion. Originally, notebooks worked by sending messages from the web app (the notebook you see in the browser) to an IPython kernel (an IPython application running in the background). The kernel executed the code, then sent it back to the notebook.  The current architecture is similar, drawn out below.",

You connect to the server through your browser and the notebook is rendered as a web app. Code you write in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel. The kernel runs the code and sends it back to the server, then any output is rendered back in the browser. When you save the notebook, it is written to the server as a JSON file with a `.ipynb` file extension.\n\nThe great part of this architecture is that the kernel doesn't need to run Python. Since the notebook and the kernel are separate, code in any language can be sent between them. For example, two of the earlier non-Python kernels were for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/) languages. With an R kernel, code written in R will be sent to the R kernel where it is executed, exactly the same as Python code running on a Python kernel. IPython notebooks were renamed because notebooks became language agnostic. The new name **Jupyter** comes from the combination of **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**. If you're interested, here's a [list of available kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n\nAnother benefit is that the server can be run anywhere and accessed via the internet. Typically you'll be running the server on your own machine where all your data and notebook files are stored. But, you could also [set up a server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html) on a remote machine or cloud instance like Amazon's EC2. Then, you can access the notebooks in your browser from anywhere in the world.  ",

The `escape` key changes to command mode and `s` is the shortcut for \"save.\" I'll cover command mode and keyboard shortcuts later.\n\nIn the \"File\" menu, you can download the notebook in multiple formats. You'll often want to download it as an HTML file to share with others who aren't using Jupyter. Also, you can download the notebook as a normal Python file where all the code will run like normal.

Markdown is a formatting syntax that allows you to include links, style text as bold or italicized, and format code. As with code cells, you press **Shift + Enter** or **Control + Enter** to run the Markdown cell, where it will render the Markdown to formatted text. Including text allows you to write a narrative alongside your code, as well as documenting your code and the thoughts that went into it.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of markup concepts. At the bottom of this page, you'll find very good resources to learn and practice markup concepts:\n\n## Headers\n\nYou can write headers using the pound/hash/[octothorpe](http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-oct1.htm) symbol `#` placed before the text. One `#` renders as an `h1` header, two `#`s is an h2, and so on. Looks like this:\n\n```[Markdown]\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\n```\nrenders as \n\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3",

In code cells, you can write any code, assigning variables, defining functions and classes, importing packages, and more. Any code executed in one cell is available in all other cells.\n\nTo give you some practice, I created a notebook you can work through. Download the notebook **Working With Code Cells** below then run it from your own notebook server. Your browser might try to open the notebook file without downloading it. If that happens, right-click on the link then choose \"Save Link As...\". There are two ways to open the downloaded notebook locally:\n1. In your terminal, change to the directory with the notebook file, then enter `jupyter notebook`. \n2. If you have a Notebook server already up and running, you can either put the newly-downloaded file into the current working directory or use the “Upload” option in the NOtebook server. \n",

Line magics apply only to the line the magic command is written on, while cell magics apply to the whole cell.\n\n**NOTE:** These magic keywords are specific to the normal Python kernel. If you are using other kernels, these most likely won't work.\n\n## Timing code\n\nAt some point, you'll probably spend some effort optimizing code to run faster. Timing how quickly your code runs is essential for this optimization. You can use the `timeit` magic command to time how long it takes for a function to run, like so:\n\n\n\n",

By default, figures will render in their own window. However, you can pass arguments to the command to select a specific [\"backend\"](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend), the software that renders the image. To render figures directly in the notebook, you should use the inline backend with the command `%matplotlib inline`.\n\n> **Tip:** On higher resolution screens such as Retina displays, the default images in notebooks can look blurry.

Jupyter comes with a utility called `nbconvert` for converting to HTML, Markdown, slideshows, etc. The general syntax to convert a given `mynotebook.ipynb` file to another FORMAT is:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to FORMAT mynotebook.ipynb\n```\nThe currently supported output `FORMAT` could be either of the following (ignore case):\n1. HTML,\n2. LaTeX,\n3. PDF,\n4. WebPDF,\n5. Reveal.js HTML slideshow,\n6. Markdown,\n7. Ascii,\n8. reStructuredText,\n9. executable script,\n10. notebook.\n\nFor example, to convert a notebook to an HTML file, in your terminal use\n```bash\n# Install the package below, if not already\npip install nbconvert\njupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb\n```\n>**Note** - If you wish to install any package in conda that is **not** available in Anaconda distribution, such as the Airbase package, use `pip install airbase`, instead of `conda install airbase`. \n\nConverting to HTML is useful for sharing your notebooks with others who aren't using notebooks. Markdown is great for including a notebook in blogs and other text editors that accept Markdown formatting.\n",
