Hi. Welcome to Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.015
My name is Luis Serrano.

00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm a course developer here at Udacity.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.625
But before I work here, I was working on machine learning at Google for a few years.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:18.210
I was using machine learning algorithm to generate video recommendations at YouTube.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.450
Machine learning is widely used for many cool things such

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.885
as image and voice recognition, spam detection,

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:27.575
fraud detection, stock market,

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:29.620
teaching a computer how to play chess,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.175
and of course, self-driving cars.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:35.010
So, it may sound like something so useful,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.340
must be pretty complicated.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.895
But I'm here to show you that machine learning is actually pretty easy.

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:42.180
And most importantly, a lot of fun.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.130
So, first stop.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.080
What is machine learning?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580
Well, we have the world,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.660
and in the world, we have humans and we have computers.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.035
And one of the main differences between humans and computers is that humans

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:00.525
learn from past experiences whereas

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:04.040
computers need to be told what to do, then to be programmed.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.415
And now, the question is,

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.550
can we get computers to learn from experience, too?

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.945
And the answer is yes, we can.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.620
And that is precisely what machine learning is.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.420
Teaching computers to learn to perform tasks from past experiences.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.030
Of course, for computers,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.980
past experiences are just recorded as data.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.780
So, together, we're going to look at few examples in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.985
which we can teach the computer to learn from previous data.

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:33.150
And most importantly, I'm going to show you that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.970
machine learning is actually pretty easy, and nothing to fear.
